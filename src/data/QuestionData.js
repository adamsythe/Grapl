When we talk about people who have one night stands, we often think of them in one of two ways — they're either exciting, spontaneous, and adventurous, or they've made a regrettable decision and will almost certainly wake up ashamed of what they've done. No matter what, the depictions of one night stands makes them seem like something not many people actually do.

But new statistics from a survey of 1,000 people shatters all of those stereotypes.

Data scientists at DrEd.com asked 500 Americans and 500 Europeans how they feel about one night stands, and how many they've had so far. The most surprising result? Way more people are having one night stands than you'd probably think.

The survey found that 66% of participants have had at least one one night stand in their life — that's about 660 of the 1,000 people they asked.

And many of them have had more than one. American men said they've had an average of seven one night stands and American women have had six. Europeans stacked up a little lower, with six one night stands for European men and four for women. (The survey doesn't indicate if anyone who does not identify as a man or a woman answered the questions.)

When it comes to where people pick up their sexual partners, the survey results aren't that surprising. A majority (42%) of Americans who have one night stands find their partner at a bar, though clubs and dating apps come in at close seconds with 25% and 21% respectively.
Unfortunately, no matter the location, a majority of women were unsatisfied by their one night stands. About 81% of American women did not enjoy their brief encounters as much as they hoped they would.

Further research done by the same group revealed women chose to describe these interactions as unsatisfactory since most of them felt that at some point in the evening (around 32% of participants) they wanted the evening to end but their male counterpart was ignoring their verbal and non-verbal queues.

The issue of this question is one of consent. The definition of consent varies all around the world, but is broadly defined as "free agreement" or "free and voluntary agreement".

It essentially means a person must have the full capacity to make a decision about whether they want to engage in a sexual act, without force, coercion or deception.

There are a bunch of different situations where a person cannot consent - such as when someone is asleep, or is too intoxicated.

Consent can also be revoked at any point, and just because someone consented to sex in the past doesn't mean it's OK the next time.			

How we define consent - legally, and culturally - has come a long way in recent years. It used to be that a person had to say no if they weren't consenting.

Dr Nicola Henry says that's changed.

"Things have thankfully moved on, now we require a free agreement and a positive indication of consent," she said. Tasmania has the most rigorous consent laws in the country, based on the communicative or affirmative model.

In Tasmania, to have sex you must take steps to ensure you have consent; it's not enough to assume consent. "Reasonable steps might include things like asking the other person, or by looking at body language, facial expressions and verbal cues."

Enthusiastic consent is, in many ways, self-explanatory. It's the model of consent that encourages people to make sure the person they're about to have sex with is enthusiastic about the sexual interaction and wants to be there.

This week, the NSW Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward advocated for this model of consent.

Saxon Mullins - the woman who accused Luke Lazarus of rape - also supports this.

"On a social level, we need to teach people about making sure that the person you are with wants to be with you," she told Four Corners.

"All you need to say is, 'do you want to be here? And very clearly, 'do you want to have sex with me? Do you want to be doing what we're doing?'

"And if it's not an enthusiastic yes, then it's not enough."

The #metoo campaign has brought back into the public discourse issues around consent—what it is and what it’s not.

I am a psychotherapist, working a great deal with the aftermath of trauma of all sorts.
			
Today, in the era of social media, I have heard dozens of stories where young women fear that their refusal of unwanted sexual advances will be misrepresented. Social media erodes our boundaries. Countless others always seem to be watching, potentially sharing and distorting one’s story.
			
I also see my own clients’ agonizing over what might be their own culpability or contribution in their experience of abuse.
			
I want to share some of my reflections with you here.
			
In the early to mid-1980s, while working in an acute psychiatric admissions unit, I argued with colleagues that adult incest survivors were not ‘just’ schizophrenic/delusional or psychotic—as they were routinely diagnosed. I pushed to have their experience recognized for what it was — PTSD — which shifted their suffering from being something wrong with them, to an acknowledgement that it was a reaction to something appalling that had been done to them.			

In my time working with sexual assault, be that child or adult targets, the issue of ‘consent’ has always been central. I have sat in courtrooms and heard comments about how my client, a child or young person, ‘invited’ or ‘collaborated’ in their abuse. I have sat with adult rape victims in courtrooms where the rapist claimed ‘consent’ was given — despite toxicology reports showing the target had been given Rohypnol (the ‘date rape drug’) or when she had been physically assaulted and threatened.

To this day, I hear about many situations where a ‘yes’ is given, or assumed, and later I hear a whole lot of pain and distress suggesting that the ‘yes’ was not really that at all.

Let’s start with a few basics. Consent means the choice to say ‘yes’ to something.  A meaningful YES requires the capacity to choose to say NO and to have that NO heard and respected.

It was just over four years ago. I was 22, newly single, and in college. I had just broken up with my long-distance girlfriend of five years and had spent the past few years hearing all about my friends’ and roommates’ hookups. I was excited to be single and date around. I kept a mental list of several women around school whom I wanted to sleep with.

I had an acquaintance, “Julie,” who was on that list. I’m not using her real name here, and I’m writing this piece anonymously, to protect both of our privacy. We had been to parties together, laughed together, and on a couple of occasions, I had walked her home. We liked each other enough to flirt, which eventually turned into the occasional texting conversation or phone call. I got the sense she was attracted to me.
			
After a couple of weeks of texting, Julie invited me on a trip to her home a few hours away from campus. I felt a little weird about going, as we didn’t know each other very well. But I said yes — to me, the invite felt like a pretty big sign that she wanted to hook up, and I was eager to have sex.
			
We arranged our travel plans. She would drive her car, and I would sleep over at her place the night before we left because we had to wake up early.
			
That night, Julie and I hooked up — and I ignored several of her verbal and nonverbal cues telling me to stop. Years later, I have come to believe that I came alarmingly close to raping her. I’m still disturbed by how normal it felt at the time.

I arrived at Julie’s house at around 11 pm. We walked upstairs to her bedroom, which was small and cozy, lit by a star-shaped lamp.

I looked around. Her mattress was basically the only thing to sit or sleep on. It was clear — we would be sharing the bed. My face flushed, and my heart beat faster. I took this as a sign that a hookup would happen.

I lay in bed with Julie, her head resting comfortably on my chest, and we talked about this and that. We were dozing off a bit when we both turned on our sides to face each other. I could see her eyes were closed, but I sensed she was still awake. I touched my forehead to hers. She brought her mouth to mine, and we kissed.

As we were making out, we couldn’t find our rhythm. It felt like either her mouth was too small for mine or my mouth was too big. It seemed like she didn’t want to open hers all the way. I kept finding her teeth with my tongue, or going in for a mouth-half-open kiss, only to land on her pursed-shut lips. In the moment, I blamed first-hookup awkwardness.

I moved my hands under her shirt, pulled her close, grabbed her ass, and hoisted her above me so she could straddle my waist. It seemed sexy. She was still kissing me. I took off her shirt and bra.

At some point, I went down on her. I don’t remember any verbal cues to stop, but what I do remember is a significant nonverbal cue: She wasn’t making any sound. No moans, no breaths, no words. She seemed stiff. But I kept going because, well, I thought that oral sex was something people typically enjoyed. I worried I wasn’t doing it right, so I tried different spots and techniques, but nothing changed.

After some time, which I now realize was far too long, I stopped and asked if she was okay. She hesitated before speaking, and sat up.

“I don’t think we should have sex. We’re friends, and I think having sex will make things complicated.”

I responded almost immediately. “I don’t think it will make things complicated. I’m totally fine with figuring that out later.” I kind of laughed, I think, because I thought I was being charming. My feelings at the time were: We’re in the middle of having sex. It’s already complicated. Stopping now doesn’t make it less complicated. I was also horny, and Julie was hot, so I disregarded her feelings; I lurched toward her and starting kissing her neck.

“Are you sure you want to stop?” I whispered in her ear as I moved my hand toward her crotch.

“I just don’t think we should, because we’re friends.”

She never physically stopped me from touching her. At the time, I took that as a sign that she actually wanted me to continue. Her verbal objections, I convinced myself, were her poetic way of telling me she liked me enough to want to be in a relationship with me.

She was telling me to stop. And I didn’t. At least not at first. Instead, I continued to touch her clitoris, kiss her neck, and take off my underwear. She continued to say nothing and do nothing, and she was still stiff. I rubbed my penis across the outside of her vagina. She was wet. I convinced myself that this was further evidence that she wanted it.

I considered myself a feminist back then. I still do — I fight for gender equality, and I actively try to be a better man every day. But it still took me years to realize that what I did to Julie was wrong. It was coercive. She told me she “didn’t think we should have sex,” and I kept trying anyway.

I thought I was getting signals from Julie that she wanted to have sex before the encounter started — the flirting, inviting me to her home. Maybe she did want to have sex. But at some point, she changed her mind or, at the very least, wasn’t sure how she was feeling. It wasn’t enthusiastic consent throughout, and at two different points, she objected. I ignored that.

In the years following the incident with Julie, I began to realize, often while reading articles online about enthusiastic consent, that what had happened between us wasn’t fully consensual. But it wasn’t until I read the Aziz Ansari story and the media conversation surrounding it that I realized the extent of what I had done.

Whether you’re asking your crush out on a date, asking someone for their hand in marriage or sending flirty late-night hookup request to a dating app match, sex and love are all about connection. So naturally, having your attempt to connect slapped away with some form of “no” is a crummy thing to experience.

Depending on what your feelings for this person are and what you were asking, you might register that rejection in one of two ways: a small sting or a soul-crushing blow. But as unpleasant as getting turned down can be, the only surefire way to avoid hearing “no” is to never put yourself out there … which is a silly way to live. Every guy, no matter how handsome, rich or charming, will be denied at some point. And realistically, you’ll hear it many times in your life, in very different ways from very different people.
			
Rejection is a normal and healthy part of dating — it implies that people have opinions, preferences and standards. We aren’t simply dating each other out of convenience, kindness, politeness or pity. That means if you ask someone out who doesn’t share the same interests, they’re going to shoot you down.
			
As a result, it’s in your best interest to figure out how to handle rejection when it happens to you. Rather than having a temper tantrum, being able to bounce back with grace won’t just mean you’re a more mature person — it will also help your interpersonal relationships in the long run.

Unfortunately, men have a uniquely bad reputation when it comes to handling romantic rejection (especially from women). Whether it’s an over-inflated sense of self or societal conditioning around the importance of romantic success, men’s reactions to rejection can run the gamut from using harsh language on a Tinder match who doesn’t respond fast enough to prolonged harassment, stalking, physical violence and even, in extreme cases, murder.

So why the hell do men get so angry when it comes to being turned down?

“Some men make the terrible decision to react with violence or anger because they’ve misinterpreted what so-called rejection means,” says dating coach Connell Barrett. “They think that when someone rejects them, that person is saying, ‘You’re not enough. You’re beneath me.’”

That association of rejection with belittling is a powerful one that turns up over and over in pop culture — in movies and TV, the man getting rejected is often made to look pathetic and weak; rarely is a handsome and desirable man turned down for not being a good match. Meanwhile, the hero in the story often faces an initial rejection before his persistence ultimately pays off. While that might make for a more dramatic story, it makes for a pretty bad model for how to approach dating.
